# SkullQML

QML binding for the NimSkull programming language

A direct port/copy of [nimqml](https://github.com/filcuc/nimqml) modified to work with [nimskull](https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull)

Initial copy directly from my [soft-fork](https://github.com/shayanhabibi/nimqml)

Original library by filcuc and other contributors

Modifications to run with nimskull by starsider

## Requirements
* [DOtherside](https://github.com/filcuc/DOtherSide) 0.9.X
* [Nim Skull](http://github.com/nim-works/nimskull)

## Build instructions
* Compile and Install [DOtherside](https://github.com/filcuc/DOtherSide) in your system PATH (i.e. /usr/lib)
* ```git clone https://github.com/shayanhabibi/nimqml```

### Building DOtherSide - Windows 64bit - MinGW

First, ensure that the Qt version binaries are included in path.

```
cd /cloned/Dotherside
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
cmake --build .
```

**WARNING**: the built dll is prefixed with lib which is not what nimqml tries
to load; nimqml tries to load "DOtherSide.dll" so you will need to remove the
lib prefix.

### Frequent issues:

#### Too many sections/object too large

Anything along those lines requires extra flags passed to the compiler. Try
this instead:

```
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Wa,-mbig-obj" ..
```

#### Mutex does not have a type

If getting an error like this in the build process, it is likely the gcc was not
built with posix_threading (and instead win32 threading which will not work).

Try the following to check this:

```
gcc -v
```

expected:

```
PS C:\Users\PC> gcc -v

Thread model: posix
```

Nimskull toolchain or whatever other toolchain you are using might be windows thread model.

Qt toolchain in my case had posix thread model included so I just use their gcc for 
this purpose.

> Update: Seems like its best to just use the QT gcc from the get go.
